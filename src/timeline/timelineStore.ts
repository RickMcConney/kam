// The stores replace objects rather than mutating them, so a snapshot is a
// capture of four array references — near-free to take, and an operation nobody
// touched comes back as LITERALLY THE SAME OBJECT, segments and all. That is
// what pays for this: the replay it replaced had to rebuild every op from its
// settings and then work out, by comparing settings, source geometry and tabs,
// which of the rebuilt ops could inherit the live one's segments — plus park the
// ones a scrub was about to drop, because scrubbing past an op.add left nothing
// live to inherit from. None of that question exists when the old objects are
// simply still there.
//
// The event log lives on beside it, as the strip's display and as the record of
// what each object was made from. It is no longer replayed, so it no longer has
// to be replayABLE: a new mutating action needs a chip that reads well, not an
// applyEvent case that reproduces it exactly.
// Operations are held LIVE here — the actual objects, segments and all — not
// serialized settings. That is the point: an op nobody touched comes back as
// the same object, so seconds-long adaptive/vcarve generations survive an undo
// for free. (The .fkam genesis is a serialized Checkpoint; see genesisCheckpoint.)
