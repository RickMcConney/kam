// Engraving letters into the floor of a 2 mm pocket has to start at Z = -2, not at the
// stock top. Rather than ask the user for a number (wrong by 2 mm in the wrong direction
// is a full-depth plunge into solid stock), an operation stores a REFERENCE — `StartFrom`
// — and the height is resolved from the operations that precede it, every time it
// generates. Change the pocket's depth later and the engraving follows it.
//
// SAFETY INVARIANT: no operation ever ADDS material, so any op this resolver ignores can
// only make the answer HIGHER than the real surface. Too high costs an air pass; too low
// is a crash. That is what lets the candidate filter below be as crude as it likes —
// preceding ops only, flat floors only, bbox rejection — without ever being unsafe.
//
// Deliberately NOT modelled (each one errs high, i.e. safe): v-carve, photo v-carve and
// 3D surfaces (not flat — a photo carve leaves a groove field, not a floor), drilled holes (not a surface the cutter rides on), profile slots (a
// tool-width band, rarely what anything starts from), imported G-code (opaque).
// The stock model in the simulator is the backstop that sees all of those.
