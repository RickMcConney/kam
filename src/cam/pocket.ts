// Pocket clearing — public entry point, strategy dispatch and the depth loop.
//
// The strategies live one-per-file under ./pocket/; everything they share
// (geometry/travel-safety helpers, ramp + helix entry, offset-ring building,
// contour-ring linking, the sub-stage profiler) is in ./pocket/shared.ts.
//
// Each strategy is a PLANNER: it resolves its geometry once per boundary and returns
// a PocketPlan whose emitCuts replays that geometry at each depth level (see the
// contract in ./pocket/shared.ts). This file owns the depth loop and the tail every
// strategy shares — rest cleanup, then the wall/island finishing contours.
//
// This file stays the module everything imports — several scripts/ harnesses
// import '../src/cam/pocket.ts' by explicit path.
