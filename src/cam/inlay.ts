/**
 * V-bit plunges that clear the stock inside a letter's COUNTERS that the roughing cutter
 * cannot reach.
 *
 * The wall trace leaves the plug's cone standing beside every letter edge — stock at
 * −D + u/tan(θ/2), u being the distance out from the outline. Everywhere the end mill can
 * get to, its pocket takes that away flat at −D and nothing is left. Where it cannot — a
 * counter too narrow to enter, or a corner tighter than its radius — the stock stays, the
 * female has untouched face against it, and every bit of it is interference.
 *
 * ── Only within a letter's bounding box ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every patch worth a plunge belongs to a letterform: the counters (A's triangle here is
 * narrower than a 1/8" cutter and never gets pocketed at all — enclosed by the letter, so
 * there is no second chance), and the tight outside corners where a stroke meets a bowl —
 * B's and G's junctions, E's and F's notches. All of them sit inside the letter's own
 * bounding box, so that is the test.
 *
 * The open background beyond those boxes is deliberately left alone. The V-bit runs BEFORE
 * the end mill (one tool change), so out there it would be plunging into full-depth solid
 * stock the pocket is about to remove anyway. Unrestricted, the patch test also flagged the
 * blank's own edge band and its four corners, which are far from any letter — and since the
 * allowed depth grows with distance from the letters, that came out as 146 plunges in open
 * stock, some at the bit's 5.5 mm limit in a 6 mm board. Inside a bounding box the same
 * bound is self-limiting: a patch the cutter cannot reach is by definition within a radius
 * of a letter, so nothing there can ask for more than D + R/tan(θ/2).
 *
 * ── The depth law ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A tip at q, depth z, cuts the point p down to −z + |p−q|/tan(θ/2). Two consequences:
 *
 *   SAFE:   the plug's wall must survive, and its nearest point is the outline itself, so
 *           z ≤ D + dist(q, outline)/tan(θ/2). At equality the cone lands exactly on the
 *           wall the trace already cut — it can touch it but never eat into it.
 *   USEFUL: at that same z, every p within dist(q, outline) of q is taken to −D or below.
 *
 * The bound and the reach are the same number, so one plunge at the deepest point of a
 * patch is the most any single plunge can do, and the depth is read straight off the
 * distance to the LETTER OUTLINE — never off the patch geometry. That is what makes this
 * gouge-proof: get the patch detection wrong and the worst case is a wasted plunge in
 * already-cut air. Deriving depth from a region boolean instead put 1038 mm² of B and D
 * through the letters when the boolean returned the wrong side.
 *
 * Cutting deeper than D inside a counter costs nothing — the assembly is planed back to
 * the female's face, so everything below the mating plane comes off anyway.
 *
 * Patches are found on a grid: a cell is reachable if some disc of the cutter's radius
 * covers it without touching a letter, i.e. the reachable set is the cutter-centre set
 * dilated by its own radius. Distances lose up to a cell to rasterization, so a cell's
 * diagonal is subtracted from every radius before it is used — the error can then only
 * make a plunge shallower and narrower, never deeper.

/**
 * Male text-plug algorithm — Virtual Z-Plane Shift.
 *
 * Called for multi-subpath paths (text, multi-letter shapes) where each letter
 * subpath acts as a raised prism on the plug face.
 *
 * Core principle:
 *   The V-carve runs directly on each letter boundary (not inverted), with the bit
 *   apex on the MATING plane — plugDepth below the male board's face — so the wall it
 *   leaves is the exact cone complement of the female's V-carved wall.
 *
 *   Z = plugDepthMM   (constant, every letter, every point on its boundary)
 *
 * The end mill clears the recessed background (bbox minus letter outers) to
 * pocketDepthMM, pockets any letter counters (e.g. inside of 'O') to the same
 * depth, and profiles the bounding-box perimeter to free the plug from stock.
 * glueLineMM is not applied to the male plug — it only affects the female socket,
 * and neither is clearanceMM (the socket carries the whole fit gap).
 *
 * ── Why the depth is constant ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Write both boards top-referenced, with s = distance INSIDE the letter and D = the
 * plug depth. The female is a V-carve, F = −min(s/tan(θ/2), Dmax). Tracing the male's
 * outline with the tip at −Z leaves M = min(0, −Z + s/tan(θ/2)) inside the letter and
 * −D outside it, once the background pocket has run. Turning the board over, the two
 * solids may not overlap: F + M + D ≤ 0. At Z = D that is an identity — 0 on every
 * wall and on the land outside the letters, negative (a harmless void) only where the
 * socket is deeper than the plug can reach. So the plug does fit a V-carve, exactly.
 *
 * Any other Z is a straight loss:
 *   Z > D  undercuts the plug by (Z−D)·tan(θ/2) per side and sinks a moat around each
 *          letter deeper than the background, so the boards cannot even meet at the
 *          face. A stroke narrower than 2(Z−D)·tan(θ/2) is cut away completely.
 *   Z < D  leaves the plug (D−Z) proud — it wedges, and you plane it flush. Recoverable,
 *          which is why the V-bit's reach clamp below errs in that direction.
 *
 * This used to run Z = modalMATradius/tan(θ/2), i.e. the female's own depth rule. On
 * scratch/abcdefg.fkam that put Z at 3.5–4.0 mm against a D of 2 mm: 38% of the
 * footprint cut up to 1.85 mm too deep, every 3.2 mm stroke reduced to 1.5 mm, and a
 * 1 mm-deep moat round every letter. It read as "no interference" in the fit audit
 * because an undersized plug never interferes — it just rattles.
