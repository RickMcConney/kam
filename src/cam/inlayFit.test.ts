// Does the male plug drop into the female socket?
//
// Both halves go strategy → G-code → sim parser → heightfield carve, and the two height
// maps are checked against each other. See src/sim/inlayFit.ts for the assembly maths;
// the short version is that the fit reduces to F + M + plugDepth ≤ 0 everywhere, and the
// two scores are INTERFERENCE (wood in the way, the plug will not seat) and SURFACE GAP
// (it seats, but the finished face has a hole in it).
//
// These are the tests that catch "the inlay only works for simple shapes": the failures
// below all lived in geometry that reads fine on the canvas and cuts fine on its own — an
// island in a socket, one design nested inside another — and only showed up as a plug that
// would not go in.
