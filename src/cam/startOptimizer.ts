//
// The hint is therefore applied WHEN AN OPERATION IS GENERATED (`entryHintAt`, called by
// the machine forms), not retro-fitted afterwards. Operations are cut in the order they
// were created, so at the moment one is generated its predecessor's exit is already known.
// `optimizeStartPoints` then has nothing to do on the common path: it walks the same chain,
// finds every operation already generated with the hint it would have asked for, and
// regenerates none of them. It still exists because some things do invalidate the chain —
// reordering, editing an earlier operation, or changing the safe height — and then it
// rebuilds exactly the operations affected.
