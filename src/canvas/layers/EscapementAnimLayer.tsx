/**
 * The escapement, running.
 *
 * The parts are drawn CLEAR of each other — they are two pieces to be cut, and
 * overlapping outlines would be no use on the stock — which leaves the one
 * question a drawing cannot answer: put together, do they bind? So this puts
 * them together. The anchor is slid from where it is drawn down onto the true
 * centre distance and the pair is stepped through `escapementPose`, the
 * escapement's own kinematics, at a speed slow enough to watch a tooth go past
 * a pallet.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the document. The group's own paths are hidden while it
 * runs (a static wheel sitting under the turning one is unreadable), the
 * geometry is generated once per parameter change rather than per frame, and
 * every position is a Konva transform — so the cost of a frame is two rotations.
