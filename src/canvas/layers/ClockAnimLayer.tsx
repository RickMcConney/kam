/**
 * The whole clock, assembled and running.
 *
 * The five parts are cut flat and laid out CLEAR of each other on the stock,
 * which leaves the question the drawing cannot answer: put together at the
 * spacings the panel quotes, does the train run? So this stands the arbors up at
 * those spacings and turns everything off the escapement's own kinematics.
 *
 * THE WHEELS OVERLAP, AND THEY ARE MEANT TO. Two wheels a mesh apart are 200 mm
 * of diameter across a 120 mm centre distance, because each meshes with the NEXT
 * ARBOR'S PINION and the two sit at different depths between the plates. Drawn
 * solid that reads as a crash, so each arbor gets its own hue and a translucent
 * fill — the same problem, and the same answer, as `gearMateParts` drawing a
 * lantern's cheek dashed.
 *
 * The slow end barely creeps, and that is a clock: the great wheel is geared
 * 60:1 off the escape wheel, so it turns a tooth about once a minute of watching.
 * Whether the meshes actually clear is not an eye question — it is answered by
 * `scripts/clock-mesh-check.mts`, which steps the train through forty periods and
 * measures. This is for seeing the thing stand up and the escapement beat.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the document: every clock path is hidden while it runs,
 * geometry is built once per parameter change, and a frame is nine Konva
 * transforms.
