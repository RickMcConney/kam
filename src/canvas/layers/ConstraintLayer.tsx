// Dimensions for the constraints on the current selection.
//
// SCREEN SPACE, so the line stays one pixel and the label readable at every
// zoom — this sits in the stage's screen-space overlay layer, not the Y-flipped
// CNC layer, which is also what lets the label be drawn the right way up
// without a counter-flip.
//
// EVERY NUMBER HAS ITS OWN PLACE TO BE DRAWN, always. A polar constraint puts
// the distance along the line and the angle in an arc at the held end; an X/Y
// one draws an L — across, then up — and puts each offset beside its own leg.
// That is not decoration: the first cut of this drew an X and a Y dimension both
// as the line joining the two centres, so they landed exactly on top of each
// other, and on the everyday case (parts standing in a row, Y distance zero) one
// of the two numbers simply could not be read.
//
// THE ARROWHEAD POINTS AT THE END THAT TAKES UP A CHANGE TO THE NUMBERS. It does
// NOT say which part may be dragged — the solve anchors at whatever the user
// grabbed and carries the rest of the chain along, so every part is equally
// draggable (see store/constraints.ts). But typing a new distance has to move
// something, and the arrow is the whole of what says which end that is.
//
// ONLY WHILE THE CONSTRAIN TOOL IS ON. Dimensions are a drawing OF the
// constraints, and the moment you are doing something else they are clutter over
// the top of the work: selecting a part to give it a toolpath put purple lines,
// arcs and number plates across the very geometry being aimed at, and the
// selection is how every operation in the app is started. The panel still lists
// what holds a selected part — that is a list, and it is off to the side — but
// the canvas draws them only when the tool that makes them is in hand.
//
// AND THEN EXACTLY THE SET THE PANEL LISTS, through the one function both ask
// (`constraintsInFocus`). Drawing everything while the tool is on read as extra
// information and was a disagreement: pick out one corner hole holding one
// constraint and the panel said one while the canvas drew all four of the
// plate's, with nothing to say which of the two was answering the question.
//
// THE ONE BEING MADE IS DRAWN BY THIS SAME CODE, in green, from `pending`. The
// Constrain tool's second point can be DRAGGED, and what the user is dragging
// towards is a pair of numbers rather than a position — so the preview has to be
// the finished dimension, digits and all, not the dashed line to the cursor it
// started as. Drawn here rather than in the pick layer because that layer is
// inside the Y-flipped CNC layer, where a label comes out upside down, and
// because a preview that is drawn a second way would eventually stop matching
// what the constraint lands holding.
