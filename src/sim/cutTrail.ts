// ─── Cut trail accumulator (2D simulation) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The yellow "material removed so far" overlay. It is rebuilt on every animation
// frame, so its cost has to be proportional to what the tool cut SINCE THE LAST
// FRAME — not to everything cut so far. It used to be the latter, which is why a
// long program got slower the further it played: at 74k segments (a 150×100 mm
// photo v-carve) every frame walked all 74k and handed React 8,430 separate line
// nodes to reconcile and Konva 8,430 stroke calls to draw.
//
// So the geometry lives here, in a mutable accumulator the layer only ever appends
// to, and it comes out in a shape the layer can draw in a handful of canvas calls:
//
//   byWidth   — polylines grouped by stroke width, rounded to 0.1 mm. A V-bit's cut
//               width tracks its depth, so a depth-varying pass produces a new width
//               every few segments; grouping by width means one beginPath+stroke per
//               DISTINCT width instead of one per run of segments.
//   frustums  — segments whose start and end widths differ by more than the rounding
//               (a plunge, a ramp, a steep V-carve descent). A stroke can't taper, so
//               these are filled as trapezoids.
//
// Rewinding the scrubber, loading another program, or moving the work origin drops
// everything and replays — correctness first; those are not per-frame events.
