// ─── Weight-driven clock train ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is NOT a shape. It is a small designer that emits SEVERAL ordinary shapes
// — cycloidal wheels with lantern pinions, and one escapement — each landing
// as its own chip with its own parameters, so every wheel stays independently
// editable afterwards. That is the whole reason it is not a `ShapeType`: a shape
// is one set of params, and a clock is several sets that only agree about the
// tooth and pin counts.
//
// What it works out, and what it deliberately does not:
//
//   • THE PENDULUM comes from the beat and nothing else. A pendulum's period is
//     T = 2π√(L/g), the beat is half a period, so L = g·(2·beat)²/4π². A one
//     second beat gives the familiar 994 mm seconds pendulum.
//
//   • THE GOING TRAIN is then forced. The escape wheel gives up half a tooth per
//     beat, so it turns once every `2·beat·escapeTeeth` seconds; the great wheel
//     is required to turn once every `greatWheelMin` minutes (60 puts the minute
//     hand straight on it). The ratio between those two is what the train's
//     meshes must produce EXACTLY — a train off by a thousandth is 86 seconds a
//     day —
//     which is why `solveTrain` searches integer factorisations rather than
//     rounding a cube root.
//
//   • THE DRIVE WHEEL is the opposite case, and the distinction matters. It
//     carries the weight drum and drives the great wheel's pinion, so it sets
//     only how long the clock runs between winds. Nothing about the RATE depends
//     on it, so its ratio is simply rounded to a whole tooth and the achieved
//     run time reported back. Asking a search to hit a run time exactly would be
//     solving for a number nobody measures.
//
// Every wheel drives the pinion of the wheel AFTER it, so each gear is emitted
// with `emitPinion` — the pinion beside the great wheel is the SECOND wheel's,
// and the one beside the LAST train wheel is the escape wheel's. The escapement
// generator emits no pinion of its own, which is exactly right: that last
// wheel's is it. The great wheel therefore has a pinion driven by the drive
// wheel, and the drive wheel is the one wheel in the clock with nothing driving
// it but the cord.
//
//   • HOW MANY WHEELS is the spec's (`trainWheels`): three by default — great,
//     second, escape, the classic English longcase train and what a wooden clock
//     wants — or four for a clock designed before there was a choice. It decides
//     more than a part count: every mesh reverses the rotation, so it also fixes
//     which way the escape wheel must run for the minute hand to go clockwise
//     (`escapeClockwiseFor`).

 * (`π·m − pin Ø − backlash`), so every millimetre of pin is a millimetre off the

// diameter `m × z` — with `z` forced by the rate — so nothing about how big the
// wheels come out is anyone's choice. The default train (48/48/45 at m4) is
// three ~200 mm wheels on a 300 mm board for exactly that reason.
//
// A mesh only requires that its OWN two members share a module: the wheel's face
// is the epicycloid of the lantern's pin circle, and that circle is the pinion's
// pitch circle at the mesh's module. Nothing couples one mesh to the next, so
// each may have its own. There is no gear cutter here — a router follows an
// outline — so the usual reason to standardise on one pitch does not apply.
//
// TOOTH SIZE FALLS TOWARD THE ESCAPEMENT, which is what a real clock does and is
// about load rather than looks: torque drops by the mesh ratio at every step, so
// the drive end carries some sixty times the escape end's. One module leaves the
// great wheel's teeth marginal for their load or the escape wheel's needlessly
// coarse for theirs. `toothTaper` is the ratio between one mesh's module and the
// next along (0.8 = each mesh a fifth finer than the one before it; 1 = uniform,
// which is what every clock designed before this did).
//
// The family is then SCALED so the biggest wheel just fits `maxWheelDia` — the
// one number a maker actually has, being the width of the board. `outsideDia` is

// centre distances are the same distance, and with a lantern pinion of P pins
// sitting on a pitch circle of `m·P/2` (`describingRadius`, the same rule the
// wheels' teeth are cut to) that says
//
//     P₁ + T₁ = P₂ + T₂,   T₁ = r₁·P₁,   T₂ = r₂·P₂,   r₁·r₂ = 12

  // RADIUS). So `pinDia` is this wheel's own mesh's, and `arborPinDia` — the

/**
 * Lay the parts out shelf-packed and CENTRED ON THE STOCK, wrapping downward.
 *
 * Centred rather than run out from a corner because these are big: an m4
 * 48-tooth wheel is 200 mm across against a 300 mm stock, so nearly every part
 * takes a row to itself and a corner-anchored pack comes out as a column hugging
 * one edge and trailing off the bottom. Centred, the block straddles the middle
 * whatever it does not fit.
 *
 * THE PENDULUM IS NOT PACKED WITH THEM — it stands beside the stock. A seconds
 * pendulum is 994 mm of rod against a 300 mm board, so packed in it took a row
 * of its own a metre tall and pushed the entire train off the top of the stock
 * on its way to centring the block: the one part that will never be cut from
 * this board decided where every wheel went. It is not stock-sized furniture
 * and there is nothing to gain by pretending it is, so it is set to the RIGHT
 * of the board, hanging down from the top edge the way it hangs in the clock,
 * and the wheels are then centred on the stock without it.
 *
 * They are placed CLEAR of each other, never at their true centre distances —
 * these are parts to be cut, and two wheels drawn in mesh would overlap on the
 * stock. The spacings a plate is drilled from are reported by the panel instead.
 *
 * Each part is measured from its own emitted geometry rather than from a formula
 * per shape: a gear's bbox includes the pinion drawn beside it and an
 * escapement's includes its anchor, and neither is worth restating here.
 *
 * ORDER IS PRESERVED, including for a part with no geometry — callers index the
 * result against the parts they passed in.

// ─── Assembled: where the arbors go, and where everything stands ──────────────
//
// The parts are drawn CLEAR of each other on the stock, which leaves the one
// question a drawing of loose wheels cannot answer: assembled, does the train
// run? `clockPlate` puts the arbors at their true spacings and `clockPose`
// turns everything from the escapement's own kinematics, which is what the
// canvas preview (canvas/layers/ClockAnimLayer.tsx) draws.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE TRUE OF THIS AND EASY TO GET WRONG.
//
// (1) Only the DISTANCES between arbors are forced — the directions are the
//     plate designer's choice, since a mesh only cares that the pitch circles
//     are tangent. So the angles are the USER'S (`ClockSpec.linkAngles`, dragged
//     on the canvas), and `defaultLinkAngles` is only where a clock starts.
//
//     THE CHAIN IS ROOTED AT THE ESCAPE ARBOR and walks BACKWARDS from it to the
//     drive wheel. That is not a convenience. The anchor sits +y from the escape
//     wheel in the escapement's own frame and the pendulum hangs from the anchor,
//     so rooting anywhere else would let a link angle tip the escapement — the
//     anchor would stop being above its wheel and the pendulum would hang
//     sideways, which means rotating the escapement's whole drawn frame and
//     re-checking `escapementPose`. Rooted here, none of that geometry moves at
//     all. It is also how a movement is really laid out: the pendulum defines the
//     vertical, the escapement is fixed to it, and the train is arranged round it.
//
// (2) SUCCESSIVE WHEELS OVERLAP IN PLAN VIEW, and that is correct, not a bug to
//     lay out around. The great wheel's radius plus the second wheel's is 200 mm
//     against a 120 mm centre distance: they cannot help but overlap, because in
//     a real movement each wheel meshes with the NEXT ARBOR'S PINION and the two
//     wheels sit at different depths between the plates. Trying to separate them
//     would mean lying about the spacings. It is the same fact `gearMateParts`
//     handles by drawing a lantern's cheek dashed — the preview draws the wheels
//     translucent and in different hues for the same reason.

 * different depths along their arbors, so the outlines cross and the material
 * never does (`clockWheelClashes` ignores neighbours for exactly this reason).
 * An ARBOR is not at a depth — it is a rod running the whole way from plate to
 * plate, so it sweeps every depth, and a wheel whose tip circle contains one has
 * nowhere to turn.
 *
 * A normal train never trips it, and the reason is worth knowing: the centre
 * distance is the wheel's pitch radius plus its pinion's, while the wheel
 * reaches one addendum past its pitch circle — so it clears the next arbor by
 * `m·(pins/2 − 1)`, which is 20 mm for a 12-pin m4 pinion and shrinks as the
 * pinion does. Folding the linkage tight is what breaks it.
