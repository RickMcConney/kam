// ─── Involute spur gear ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A real involute gear, not a rounded-tooth lookalike: the flanks are the true
// involute of the base circle, which is the only profile that transmits constant
// angular velocity through the mesh and the only one that stays conjugate when
// the centre distance drifts. The involute of a circle of radius r_b is the
// curve traced by the end of a string unwound from it, so the point at radius r
// stands at polar angle
//
//     inv(α_r) = tan α_r − α_r,     α_r = arccos(r_b / r)
//
// A tooth flank is that curve, rotated so it crosses the pitch circle at half
// the tooth thickness. Standard tooth thickness at the pitch circle is half the
// circular pitch, so the half-angle there is π/(2z), and the flank's angle at
// the base circle is
//
//     ψ = π/(2z) + inv(α)
//
// with α the nominal pressure angle. Everything else follows: the flank is
// φ(r) = ψ − inv(α_r), the tooth is that curve and its mirror, and the gear is
// z copies of it.
//
// Proportions are ISO full-depth: addendum = m, dedendum = 1.25 m, so the pitch
// diameter is m·z, the outside diameter m(z+2) and the root m(z−2.5). Module and
// tooth count set the size; the base diameter is m·z·cos α and cannot be dialled
// in independently, which is why it is a READOUT (`gearDims`) rather than a
// parameter.
//
// Two things a gear generator has to get right or it hands you a broken part:
//
//   ROOT. Below the base circle there is no involute — the curve does not exist
//   there — so the flank runs radially down to the root circle. A hobbed gear
//   would undercut instead; a radial root is stronger and is what a cut-on-a-
//   router gear wants. The corner it leaves is filleted by a CLOSING of radius
//   0.38 m, which is the standard rack-tip radius, so every root in the gear is
//   filleted by one pass and the tooth tips (convex) are left untouched.
//
//   POINTED TEETH. On a low tooth count the two flanks meet before they reach
//   the nominal tip, and carrying on regardless crosses them over and produces a
//   self-intersecting outline. The tip is therefore clamped to the radius where
//   the tooth thickness reaches zero, which is what the tooth physically does.
//
// Emitted as separate parts — rim outline, bore, spoke windows, and the engraved
// tooth count — because those are different cuts (`generateGearParts`).

/**
 * THE TROCHOIDAL ROOT — what a hob actually leaves, and the undercut with it.
 *
 * A gear is generated by a rack rolling on its pitch circle. The rack's straight
 * flank cuts the involute; its TIP, rounded to the rack-tip radius, cuts
 * everything below — and what that leaves is not a circular fillet but the
 * envelope of the tip radius as it sweeps, a trochoid. On a normal tooth count
 * the difference is small. On a low one it is the whole point: the tip swings so
 * far round that it eats into the flank it has just cut, and THAT is undercut.
 *
 * The generator used to run the flank radially to the root and fillet the corner
 * with a closing, which is a fair approximation of a hobbed root and no
 * approximation at all of an undercut one — it left the full flank standing where
 * a hob would have cut it away, so a small mate fouled the wheel it was drawn to
 * run with (0.107 mm on a 24 × 8 pair at 20°, which the mesh preview showed).
 *
 * THE CONSTRUCTION. Roll the rack: the gear turns θ while the rack translates by
 * r·θ along the pitch line. A rack point `(ξ, η)` — ξ along the pitch line, η
 * outward from it — lands in the gear's own frame at
 *
 *     X = (r + η)·cos θ + (ξ + rθ)·sin θ
 *     Y = −(r + η)·sin θ + (ξ + rθ)·cos θ
 *
 * Track the CENTRE of the tip fillet through that, and the cut surface is the
 * point of the fillet circle that is instantaneously in contact. For rolling
 * motion contact lies where the common normal passes through the pitch point —
 * the instant centre — so it is simply the fillet centre pushed a radius directly
 * away from the pitch point:
 *
 *     root(θ) = C(θ) + ρ · unit( C(θ) − P(θ) ),   P(θ) = the pitch point
 *
 * which needs no envelope algebra and no differentiation of the trochoid.
 *
 * Returned as (r, a) against the SPACE's centreline, one side only: the other is

// ─── Cycloidal teeth ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A clock wheel is not a machine gear. It turns slowly, it is cut in wood or
// brass by hand-guided tools, and it drives a pinion of six to twelve leaves —
// often a LANTERN pinion, which is not a toothed wheel at all but a cage of round
// pins. An involute wheel run against pins is not conjugate to them: the ratio
// wobbles within each tooth, which in a clock train shows up as a tick in the
// rate and as wear at one spot on every pin. Cycloidal teeth are the answer, and
// they predate involutes in horology by centuries.
//
// The law behind them: if the face of one wheel above its pitch circle is an
// EPICYCLOID traced by a circle rolling on that pitch circle, then the mating
// flank below ITS pitch circle is the HYPOCYCLOID traced by the same describing
// circle rolling inside the mate's pitch circle — and the pair transmits constant
// angular velocity.
//
// This generator cuts wheels for LANTERN pinions, which is what wooden clocks use.
// A pin has no flank; the pin IS the tooth. Relative to the wheel, the pin's CENTRE
// traces the epicycloid of the pinion's FULL pitch circle (a point of that circle
// as it rolls), and the pin's surface stands one radius off it — so the wheel's
// face is that epicycloid OFFSET INWARD by the pin radius, the envelope of the pin
// circles. Which is why pin diameter is a tooth-FORM parameter here and not just a
// detail of the pinion. (A leaved pinion would want a describing circle of HALF the
// pinion's pitch radius, so the hypocycloid inside it degenerates to a straight
// radial flank — the Cardan couple. Nothing here does that; adding it would mean
// generating the pinion too, and verifying the mesh against its leaves.)
//
// Below the pitch circle the wheel's tooth does no driving (with a lantern the
// action is entirely on the recess side), so the flank runs RADIALLY down to the
// root — the same answer, and for the same reason, as the involute generator's
// sub-base-circle run.
//
// Placement is free: rotating a conjugate profile about its own axis only phases
// the mesh, it does not break conjugacy. So the face curve is placed with its
// inner end ON the pitch-line flank, which keeps tooth thickness the designed
// figure (`halfToothAngle`) instead of letting the pin radius eat it.

// together? That is what `gearMesh` and `gearPose` are for, and what the canvas
// Animate button shows — the mate slid onto the true centre distance and the
// pair turned.
//
// PHASE IS THE WHOLE OF IT. Tooth 0 is centred on angle 0 (both profiles build
// their teeth at `i · pitch`), so with the mate placed along +x the gear puts a
// tooth straight down the line of centres. The mate must therefore present a
// SPACE there, or the two are drawn one on top of the other. Which is a half
// pitch of the MATE, not of the gear:
//
//   a mate gear   — teeth at θ + j·2π/z₂, spaces at θ + (j+½)·2π/z₂ → θ₀ = π − π/z₂
//   a lantern     — pins  at θ + j·2π/P,  the gap between two of them → θ₀ = π + π/P
//
// Get it wrong and nothing errors: the preview just shows two solids passing
// through each other, which is why `scripts/gear-mesh-check.mts` measures it.
//
// THAT CENTRES THE MATE IN ITS PLAY, which is not how a pair runs. Under load
// the driver's tooth rests on one flank and the whole of the play shows as a gap
// behind it, and that is worth seeing — it is the only way a drawing tells you
// how much slop the pair has. The play is a length along the common pitch line
// and needs no search to find:
//
//     play = circular pitch − the mate's width there − this gear's tooth
//
// (the mate's width being a tooth for a gear and a PIN for a lantern), which
// measures against the emitted outlines to 0.005 mm. Half of it, taken at the
// mate's pitch radius, is the shift onto the driving flank. Two gears of equal
// backlash come out at exactly the backlash, as they must; a lantern comes out
// at whatever the pin leaves, which is a good deal more.
//
// WHICH FLANK IS THE DRIVING ONE DEPENDS ON WHICH WAY THE GEAR TURNS, so
// `driveSense` says. A gear previewed on its own is turned CCW by `gearPose`,
// which is the default; a clock train is a chain of external meshes and its
// wheels therefore turn ALTERNATELY, so half of them run the other way and take
// the play up on the other side of the pin. Nothing errors when it is wrong —
// the pair still runs, with the slop drawn ahead of the drive instead of behind
// it, which reads as the PINION driving the WHEEL.

 * not a shortcut: a lantern's cheeks are larger than its pin circle and the
 * wheel's teeth reach INSIDE that circle, so in plan view the cheek genuinely
 * covers the teeth — the wheel runs BETWEEN the two cheeks, axially. Drawn solid
 * it reads as a catastrophic collision; drawn dashed it reads as what it is,
 * something on another plane. The pins are the whole of the mesh anyway.
