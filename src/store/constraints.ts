// ─── Constraints ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHERE ONE PART SITS RELATIVE TO ANOTHER, held as either is edited. Everything
// else in the document is a property OF an object — `shapeParams`, `definition`,
// `placement`, `corners` — and rides on it. A constraint is the one thing that
// belongs to neither of its ends, so it lives in a store of its own
// (`constraintsStore`) rather than being stamped onto both paths the way a
// clock's spec is onto its parts.
//
// ONE CONSTRAINT PER PAIR, HOLDING A DISTANCE AND AN ANGLE — polar, not X and Y.
// It replaced separate X and Y constraints and is better on three counts:
//
//  - It DRAWS. An X dimension and a Y dimension between the same two centres are
//    two labels fighting for the same midpoint, and on the everyday case — parts
//    standing in a row, so the Y distance is zero — the Y dimension collapses to
//    a point sitting exactly on the X label and one of the two numbers simply
//    cannot be read. A distance goes along the line and an angle goes in an arc
//    at the far end: two different places, always.
//  - It is the way the work is actually described. A centre distance and a
//    direction is what a linkage, a bolt circle or a gear train is dimensioned
//    by — and it is already this app's own model for a clock, whose `ClockSpec`
//    stores `linkAngles` and never the link lengths those angles force.
//  - It makes the graph simple. Two constraints per pair meant reasoning about
//    which of them fixed which degree of freedom; one edge per pair means a
//    component is solvable exactly when it is a forest, and a cycle is the whole
//    of what over-constrained means.
//
// Either half may be left off: distance alone lets the part swing on a circle,
// angle alone lets it slide along the ray, and both together pin it outright.
//
// THERE IS NO ROOT. The solve starts from whatever the current edit moved (see
// `solveConstraints`), so every part of a chain is equally draggable and the
// rest follow. `from`/`to` survives for one question only — which end takes up a
// change to the NUMBERS — and that is what the arrowhead on the dimension line
// means. What this buys against a bidirectional sketch solver: the walk is
// exact and identical every run (so a toolpath can be diffed byte-for-byte
// across a constraint edit), a cycle is an error the user is told about rather
// than a system quietly converging on one of several answers, and it emits a
// TRANSLATE — the same road a drag takes — so nothing downstream (CAM, sim,
// save, export) learns a new concept.
//
// EVERY NUMBER IS STATED IN THE `from` PART'S OWN FRAME, and every anchor is a
// corner of that part's box MEASURED IN THAT FRAME. Both used to be world-axis,
// and the everyday case broke: four holes constrained to the corners of a plate
// followed a SCALE correctly and flew apart under a ROTATE, because an
// axis-aligned box round a tilted rectangle grows by √2 and its corners stand
// out in empty space. Stating the offsets in the parent's frame is the other
// half — "10 in from that corner" means along the plate's edges, or it is not
// what a machinist drew. Rotation only, never scale or shear: a typed 10 mm
// stays 10 mm when the plate is stretched, which `placement` makes easy to hold
// because a scale edits the definition and never lands there.
//
// With those two, a chain rotates correctly through a solve that only ever
// TRANSLATES — the target point turns with the parent, so a round hole needs
// nothing more. `alignDeg` is what the parts that are not round need: it holds
// the angle BETWEEN the two parts, so the follower turns as well as moves, and
// the whole chain behaves like the group the user thinks it is.
//
// Nothing here touches the store. Data in, moves out, so it tests in the node
// environment the rest of the suite runs in.
