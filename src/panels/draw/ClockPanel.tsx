// The clock designer.
//
// Everything mechanical is in shapes/clockTrain.ts; this panel is the numbers a
// clockmaker actually dials in, the readouts that say what came of them, and the
// button that lays the parts out on the stock.
//
// The one design decision worth restating here: it emits FIVE INDEPENDENT
// SHAPES, one chip each, not a single "clock" shape. A wheel's bore, hub, spoke
// count, backlash and markings are all things a maker changes per wheel once the
// train is settled, and a shape is one set of parameters. So the clock passes
// each wheel only what the train forces on it — its tooth count, the pins of the
// pinion it drives, the module and the cycloidal profile — and takes everything
// else from the user's own Gear and Escapement defaults. After the click there
// is no clock left in the document, only five ordinary shapes that happen to
// mesh, each editable through its own chip in the usual way.
