Shift-click to toggle membership in a multi-selection. Drag handles to move, scale, or rotate. Hold Alt while dragging a corner handle to skew (shear) instead of scale.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Export SVG',
    desc: 'The toolbar Export SVG button writes the selected paths — or every visible path when nothing is selected — as an SVG in millimetres, with the stock as the page, so a path lands back where it was drawn when the file is imported into a project with the same stock. Path names ride along and come back as names. It carries OUTLINES only: a gear arrives as a shape with no module or tooth count, and images and STL bounding boxes are left out. To move work between two projects of this app, use Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V instead, which keeps the objects.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Copying between projects',
    desc: 'Ctrl+C copies the selected paths and Ctrl+V pastes them — into the same project, or into another one open in a second tab or window. The copy carries the OBJECTS, not just their outlines: a gear arrives with its module and tooth count still editable, a clock as one clock, a group as one group, and holding tabs come with the path. Provenance (an offset, a pattern, a boolean) survives only when the paths it was generated from are copied too, since a form has nothing to re-run without them. Pasting back into the project it came from nudges the copy 5 mm clear; into another project it lands where it was drawn. Operations are not copied — they name a tool and a floor the other project need not have.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Groups',
    desc: 'Select several paths and press Ctrl+G (or Group in the Properties panel) to tie them together: clicking any member then selects the whole group, so they move, scale, rotate and delete as one thing, and the Objects strip shows them as one chip. Ctrl+Shift+G ungroups. To get at a single path inside a group, Alt-click it on the canvas or click it in the Paths list. Groups nest: group a group with a shape and ungrouping gives back that group and that shape, one level at a time.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Shape tools',
    desc: 'Pick a shape from the Draw tab. Click the canvas to place it at the default size, or drag to size it interactively. Tick From centre and a drag grows outward from where it started instead of running corner to corner — drag repeatedly from one point for concentric shapes. A gear, escapement, pendulum or train track ignores the drag and places at the size its own parameters give it — those are set by module and tooth count, by the beat, or by the piece it has to connect to, not by how far you drag. Edit parameters in the Properties panel.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Pen tool',
    desc: 'Click to place points. In Bezier mode, drag to pull out curve handles. In all other modes curves are computed automatically from point positions. Hold Alt while clicking to make the incoming segment a straight line. Click near the first point to close the path, or press Escape to finish an open path (2+ points required). Ctrl+Z to undo the last placed point.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Point edit',
    desc: 'Double-click any path to edit its points directly. Drag points or handles to reshape. Click on a segment to insert a new point. Hover a point and press Delete to remove it.',

    title: 'Toolpaths',
    desc: 'Select paths, then pick from CAM Operations in the Draw tab: Profile, Trochoidal, Pocket, Drill, Surface, V-Carve, Photo V-Carve, Inlay or 3D Profile. Simulate G-code previews the motion; Export G-code downloads Grbl-compatible output.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Path tools',
    desc: 'Under CAM Operations, the Path Tools row reshapes geometry rather than cutting it: Boolean (union, intersect, subtract), Offset, Pattern (linear or circular array), Tabs (holding tabs) and Corners (round, chamfer, dogbone).',
  },
  {
    title: 'Objects strip',
    desc: 'The strip under the canvas holds one chip per thing in the document — every path, every clock, every operation. Click a chip to select what it stands for and reopen the editor that made it: a gear chip its module and tooth count, a boolean chip its union or subtract, a pocket chip its depth. Editing a thing changes its chip instead of adding another, and hovering a chip and clicking its ✕ deletes the thing itself. A group, a multi-part shape or a whole Generate is one chip; tabs and corner treatments get their own, attached to the path they belong to.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Ops strip',
    desc: 'The Ops tab of the same strip is the program rather than the document: one chip per toolpath, in the order the machine will run them, which is the order G-code is written in. Operations sharing a tool are drawn as one coloured band with a marker at every tool change; drag a chip or a whole band to reorder. When the program visits a tool more than once a −N TC button appears and gathers that tool\'s operations into one step so you load it once. Hover a chip to hide an operation (hidden operations are left out of exported G-code) or to delete it.',
